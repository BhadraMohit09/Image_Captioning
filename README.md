## Context
This project aims to build an Image Captioning AI system that generates natural language captions for images. The model combines two powerful technologies: Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system uses pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as ResNet50, for extracting features from images and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based models to generate descriptive captions based on the extracted features.
